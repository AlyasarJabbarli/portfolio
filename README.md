## 📅 Roadmap

- [x] **Set up React TypeScript App**: Initialize the project with TypeScript for type safety and scalability.  
- [ ] **Create Microfrontend Architecture**:
  - Divide the project into independent apps (Home, About Me, Work, Resume, and Contact).  
  - Set up Module Federation for seamless integration.  
- [ ] **Implement Tailwind CSS**: Add responsive and modern styling to the components.  
- [ ] **Develop Home Microfrontend**:
  - Build the Home page as the first microfrontend.  
  - Add dynamic components showcasing personal branding.  
- [ ] **Add About Me Microfrontend**:
  - Include a detailed description of yourself and your journey.  
- [ ] **Develop Work Microfrontend**:
  - Showcase portfolio projects or professional achievements.  
- [ ] **Add Resume Microfrontend**:
  - Display an interactive or downloadable resume.  
- [ ] **Create Contact Microfrontend**:
  - Include a form or details to enable easy communication.  
- [ ] **Finalize Microfrontends Integration**:
  - Use Module Federation to integrate all microfrontends into the container app.  
- [ ] **Set Up Node.js Backend**:
  - Use Node.js to serve the microfrontends or support additional backend features (if needed).  
- [ ] **Optimize for Deployment**:
  - Build the project and deploy it on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or AWS.

## 🔍 How It Works

- The project is structured using a **Microfrontend Architecture**. 🧩
- Each section of the portfolio (e.g., Home, About, Work) is developed as an independent app under the `apps/` directory. 📁
- A central `container/` app integrates all microfrontends using **Module Federation**. 🤝

---

## 🌍 Deployment

1. Build the microfrontends:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. Deploy to a hosting platform like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/): 🛠️
   - Follow the platform's documentation to deploy a React or Node.js app.
